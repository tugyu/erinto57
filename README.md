I have used AI to generate a code to find all solutions to a math problem, then I extended it
The problem itself is described in erinto57.txt file in English and in Hungarian
You can use AI to translate Hungarian comments to any language you are more familiar with

Remark: Gemini pro 2.5 was not able to find all solutions and incorrectly stated that there are only 4 base solution
Currently I have no other subscriptions, and free models were not able to find even a solution
Without further instruction no tried AI was able to write even a code to find all solutions, which finish search in realistic time limit.
I had to add further instruczions, how to approach to the problem to get this result
